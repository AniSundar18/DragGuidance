**Drag-Based Image Editing using Diffusion Models**


## Abstract
Drag-based image editing is a style of image editing where the user can "drag" any points of the image to precisely reach target points. Successful drag-based editing involves moving the object as well as preserving the other details in the original image. This repository contains the code pertaining to an exploratory project that relies on using feature correspondences in large-scale diffusion models in order to perform Drag-based image editing.
